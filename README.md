## üßÆ Algorithm & Core Technology

### Max Flow Algorithm Implementation
The heart of WasteLess is an advanced recommendation system built on the Ford-Fulkerson/Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm:

- **Flow Network Construction**: Creates a bipartite graph connecting user ingredients to potential recipes
- **Weight Assignment**: Assigns weights based on:
  - Expiration urgency (higher weight for items about to expire)
  - Ingredient match quality using advanced string matching
  - Recipe relevance and nutritional balance
- **Optimal Flow Calculation**: Uses max flow to find the best ingredient-to-recipe matchings
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Comprehensive scoring system considering:
  - Coverage ratio (how many recipe ingredients are available)
  - Expiry urgency
  - Nutrition balance
  - User preferences

### Intelligent Ingredient Matching

- **Synonym Recognition**: Advanced matching for ingredient variations
- **Category Compatibility**: Ensures logical ingredient substitutions
- **Quality Scoring**: Confidence-based matching with fallback options
